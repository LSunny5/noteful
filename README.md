## Summary: 
This noteful app was created for educational purposes for providing a user to create notes and organize them through folders.  Users can delete notes, folders, as well as add folders and notes as needed.  Data is retrieved from a Node/PosgreSQL created server that is hosted on Heroku.  When users click a note they will have the option to read the whole note as well as delete. 

Authorization implementation has been started but not completed.  App is fully functional otherwise.
