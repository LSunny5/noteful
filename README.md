## Noteful JSON Server
This is a project for education purposes created by Thinkful.
This is a json-server managed API meant for developing `noteful-client` projects.
Once started, this will run a local API server on `http://localhost:9090`.

The database is initiated from the `db.js` file whenever the server is started. No data is persisted after the server has been shut down.

## Production mode
http://localhost:5000
